# Micrologic
___Note: Although accidentally having a same name, there is no relationship between this project and [Micrologic Trip Units](https://www.se.com/us/en/product-range/7223-micrologic-trip-units/#overview).___

The project aims to create a shell interpreter to run Micrologic. You may check [help.txt](Micrologic/help.txt) for more information.

A bit hard to use since there aren't any gui.

Have fun.
