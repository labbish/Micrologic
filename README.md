# Micrologic
The project aims to create a shell intepreter to run Micrologic.

A bit hard to use because of there aren't any gui.

There are a few error messages now.

(It is recommanded to use with [Micrologic IDE](https://github.com/HZZcode/MicrologicIDE) for better editing and debugging.)

Have fun.
