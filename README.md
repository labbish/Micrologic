A bit hard to use since there isn't any gui.

## Requirements
* Language version: C++20
* Supporting Libs: [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), [curl/curl](https://github.com/curl/curl), [labbish/StableVector](https://github.com/labbish/StableVector) and [labbish/Debug-Messages](https://github.com/labbish/Debug-Messages)
