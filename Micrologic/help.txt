Micrologic Help

=== Basic Principle ===

* The world of Micrologic is made up of 2 elements: "line" (including "wide line") and "block".
* A line contains a value between 0 and 1 (aka. 1bit), while a wideline contains a value ranging from 0 to 15 (aka. 4bits).
* A block has some input ports and some output ports. When you define a block, you must link all these ports to a line (or wideline). The block reads all its input values, does something inside it, and then output to the output lines linking with it.
* Every "tick", every block on the board updates its outputs based on its previous (aka. before this tick) inputs. There's no need for users to worry about "update order", because in fact the interpreter saves a snapshot of the values before this tick and update outputs based on it. So, as long as you don't set one line as an output of multiple blocks (of course this is unrecommanded!), the order doesn't matter.
* Note: Every object in Micrologic is automatically assigned a order number, and you'll have to follow it.
* Note: The order number of lines and wide lines are shared.

=== Commands ===

Note: When creating blocks, the front part are inputs and the rest are outputs. 
Note: Many commands have no error messages when you make a mistake. So be careful to what you write on your own.
Note: [ALINE] = [LINE | WLINE] below.
